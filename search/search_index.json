Vascular thrombosis\u00b6 One or more clinical episodes\u0394 of arterial, venous, or small vessel thrombosis\u25ca, in any tissue or organ. Thrombosis must be confirmed by objective validated criteria (ie, unequivocal findings of appropriate imaging studies or histopathology). For histopathologic confirmation, thrombosis should be present without significant evidence of inflammation in the vessel wall 2. Pregnancy morbidity a. One or more unexplained deaths of a morphologically normal fetus at or beyond the 10th week of gestation, with normal fetal morphology documented by ultrasound or by direct examination of the fetus; or b. One or more premature births of a morphologically normal neonate before the 34th week of gestation because of: (i) eclampsia or severe preeclampsia defined according to standard definitions, or (ii) recognized features of placental insufficiency\u00a7; or c. Three or more unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation, with maternal anatomic or hormonal abnormalities and paternal and maternal chromosomal causes excluded. In studies of populations of patients who have more than one type of pregnancy morbidity, investigators are strongly encouraged to stratify groups of subjects according to a, b, or c above. Laboratory criteria\u00a5 1. LA present in plasma, on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart, detected according to the guidelines of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (Scientific Subcommittee on LAs/phospholipid-dependent antibodies). 2. aCL of IgG and/or IgM isotype in serum or plasma, present in medium or high titer (ie, >40 GPL or MPL, or >the 99th percentile), on two or more occasions, at least 12 weeks apart, measured by a standardized ELISA. 3. Anti-beta-2 glycoprotein-I antibody of IgG and/or IgM isotype in serum or plasma (in titer >the 99th percentile), present on two or more occasions, at least 12 weeks apart, measured by a standardized ELISA, according to recommended procedures. * Classification of APS should be avoided if less than 12 weeks or more than five years separate the positive aPL test and the clinical manifestation. \u00b6 Coexisting inherited or acquired factors for thrombosis are not reasons for excluding patients from APS trials. However, two subgroups of APS patients should be recognized, according to: (a) the presence; and (b) the absence of additional risk factors for thrombosis. Indicative (but not exhaustive) cases include: age (>55 in men and >65 in women) and the presence of any of the established risk factors for cardiovascular disease (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, elevated LDL or low HDL cholesterol, cigarette smoking, family history of premature cardiovascular disease, body mass index \u226530 kg m\u20132, microalbuminuria, estimated GFR <60 mL minute\u20131), inherited thrombophilias, oral contraceptives, nephrotic syndrome, malignancy, immobilization, and surgery. Thus, patients who fulfill criteria should be stratified according to contributing causes of thrombosis. \u0394 A thrombotic episode in the past could be considered as a clinical criterion, provided that thrombosis is proved by appropriate diagnostic means and that no alternative diagnosis or cause of thrombosis is found. \u25ca Superficial venous thrombosis is not included in the clinical criteria. \u00a7 Generally accepted features of placental insufficiency include: (i) abnormal or non-reassuring fetal surveillance test(s), eg, a non-reactive non-stress test, suggestive of fetal hypoxemia; (ii) abnormal Doppler flow velocimetry waveform analysis suggestive of fetal hypoxemia, eg, absent end-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery; (iii) oligohydramnios, eg, an amniotic fluid index of 5 cm or less; or (iv) a postnatal birth weight less than the 10th percentile for the gestational age. \u00a5 Investigators are strongly advised to classify APS patients in studies into one of the following categories: I, more than one laboratory criteria present (any combination); IIa, LA present alone; IIb, aCL antibody present alone; IIc, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein-I antibody present alone. Rheumatoid arthritis 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria Target population (Who should be tested?): Patients who 1. Have at least one joint with definite clinical synovitis (swelling)* 2. With the synovitis not better explained by another disease\u2020 Classification criteria for RA (score-based algorithm: add score of categories A\u2013D; a score of \u22656 of 10 is needed for classification of a patient as having definite RA)\u2021 Score A.

Duration of symptoms\u00a7\u00a7 <6 weeks 0 \u22656 weeks 1 *The criteria are aimed at classification of newly presenting patients. In addition, patients with erosive disease typical of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with a history compatible with prior fulfillment of the 2010 criteria should be classified as having RA. Patients with longstanding disease, including those whose disease is inactive (with or without treatment) who, based on retrospectively available data, have previously fulfilled the 2010 criteria should be classified as having RA. \u2020Differential diagnoses vary among patients with different presentations but may include conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and gout. If it is unclear about the relevant differential diagnoses to consider, an expert rheumatologist should be consulted. \u2021Although patients with a score of 6 of 10 are not classifiable as having RA, their status can be reassessed, and the criteria might be fulfilled cumulatively over time. \u00a7Joint involvement refers to any swollen or tender joint on examination, which may be confirmed by imaging evidence of synovitis. Distal interphalangeal joints, first carpometacarpal joints, and first metatarsophalangeal joints are excluded from assessment. Categories of joint distribution are classified according to the location and number of involved joints, with placement into the highest category possible based on the pattern of joint involvement. \u2225\u201cLarge joints\u201d refers to shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles. \u00b6\u201cSmall joints\u201d refers to the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, second through fifth metatarsophalangeal joints, thumb interphalangeal joints, and wrists. **In this category, at least one of the involved joints must be a small joint; the other joints can include any combination of large and additional small joints, as well as other joints not specifically listed elsewhere (e.g., temporomandibular, acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular). \u2020\u2020Negative refers to IU values that are less than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory and assay; low-positive refers to IU values that are higher than the ULN but \u22643 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay; high-positive refers to IU values that are \u22653 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay. When rheumatoid factor (RF) information is only available as positive or negative, a positive result should be scored as low positive for RF. \u2021\u2021Normal and abnormal are determined by local laboratory standards. \u00a7\u00a7Duration of symptoms refers to patient self-report of the duration of signs or symptoms of synovitis (e.g., pain, swelling, tenderness) of joints that are clinically involved at the time of assessment regardless of treatment status. 1987 ACR (formerly ARA) classification criteria Criterion Description Morning stiffness Morning stiffness in and around the joints, lasting at least one hour before maximal improvement. Arthritis of three or more joint areas At least three joint areas (out of 14 possible areas; right or left PIP, MCP, wrist, elbow, knee, ankle, MTP joints) simultaneously have had soft tissue swelling or fluid (not bony overgrowth alone) as observed by a physician. Arthritis of hand joints At least one area swollen (as defined above) in a wrist, MCP, or PIP joint. Symmetric arthritis Simultaneous involvement of the same joint areas (as defined above) on both sides of the body (bilateral involvement of PIPs, MCPs, or MTPs, without absolute symmetry is acceptable). Rheumatoid nodules Subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences or extensor surfaces, or in juxta-articular regions as observed by a physician. Serum rheumatoid factor Demonstration of abnormal amounts of serum rheumatoid factor by any method for which the result has been positive in less than 5 percent of normal control subjects. Radiographic changes Radiographic changes typical of rheumatoid arthritis on posteroanterior hand or wrist radiographs, which must include erosions or unequivocal bony decalcification localised in, or most marked adjacent to, the involved joints (osteoarthritis changes alone do not qualify). Note: For classification purposes, a patient has RA if at least four of these criteria are satisfied (the first four must have been present for at least six weeks). Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 2019 ACR/EULAR classification criteria The entry criterion is necessary to classify SLE. ANA at a titer of \u22651:80 on HEp-2 cells or an equivalent positive test (ever).* At least 1 clinical criterion required to classify SLE. Additional additive (clinical or immunology) criteria are counted toward the total score : \u00b6 Do not count a criterion if there is a more likely explanation than SLE. Occurrence of a criterion on \u22651 occasion is sufficient. Criteria need not occur simultaneously. Within each domain (eg, mucocutaneous, complement proteins), only the highest-weighted criterion is counted toward the total score if more than 1 is present.

The classification is based upon 11 criteria. For the purpose of identifying patients in clinical studies, a person is said to have SLE if any 4 or more of the 11 criteria are present, serially or simultaneously, during any interval of observation. \u00b6 For the SLICC criteria, criteria are cumulative and need not be presently concurrently. A patient is classified as having SLE if he or she satisfies 4 of the clinical and immunologic criteria used in the SLICC classification criteria, including at least 1 clinical criterion and 1 immunologic criterion. \u0394 Alternatively, according to the SLICC criteria, a patient is classified as having SLE if he or she has biopsy-proven nephritis compatible with SLE in the presence of ANAs or anti-dsDNA antibodies. Sjogren syndrome 2016 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for primary Sjogren syndrome The classification of primary SS applies to any individual who meets the inclusion criteria\u00a7, does not have any of the conditions listed as exclusion criteria\u00a5, and has a score \u22654 when the weights from the five criteria items are summed.

Systemic Sclerosis 2013 ACR/EULAR classification criteria The ACR/EULAR criteria for the classification of SSc* Item (Category) Sub-item(s) Weight/score\u00b6 Skin thickening of the fingers of both hands extending proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints (sufficient criterion) \u2013 9 Skin thickening of the fingers (only count the higher score) Puffy fingers 2 Sclerodactyly of the fingers (distal to the metacarpophalangeal joints but proximal to the proximal interphalangeal joints) 4 Fingertip lesions (only count the higher score) Digital tip ulcers 2 Fingertip pitting scars 3 Telangiectasia \u2013 2 Abnormal nailfold capillaries \u2013 2 Pulmonary arterial hypertension and/or interstitial lung disease (maximum score is 2) Pulmonary arterial hypertension 2 Interstitial lung disease 2 Raynaud phenomenon \u2013 3 SSc-related autoantibodies (anticentromere, anti-topoisomerase I [anti-Scl-70], anti-RNA polymerase III) (maximum score is 3) Anticentromere Anti-topoisomerase I Anti-RNA polymerase III 3 * These criteria are applicable to any patient considered for inclusion in an SSc study. The criteria are not applicable to patients with skin thickening sparing the fingers or to patients who have a scleroderma-like disorder that better explains their manifestations (eg, nephrogenic sclerosing fibrosis, generalized morphea, eosinophilic fasciitis, scleredema diabeticorum, scleromyxedema, erythromyalgia, porphyria, lichen sclerosis, graft-versus-host disease, diabetic cheiroarthropathy). \u00b6 The total score is determined by adding the maximum weight (score) in each category. Patients with a total score of \u22659 are classified as having definite SSc. Definitions of items in the ACR/EULAR criteria for the classification of SSc Item Definition Skin thickening Skin thickening or hardening not due to scarring after injury, trauma, etc. Puffy fingers Swollen digits\u2014a diffuse, usually nonpitting increase in soft tissue mass of the digits extending beyond the normal confines of the joint capsule. Normal digits are tapered distally with the tissues following the contours of the digital bone and joint structures. Swelling of the digits obliterates these contours. Not due to other causes such as inflammatory dactylitis. Fingertip ulcers or pitting scars Ulcers or scars distal to or at the proximal interphalangeal joint not thought to be due to trauma. Digital pitting scars are depressed areas at digital tips as a result of ischemia, rather than trauma or exogenous causes. Telangiectasia Telangiectasiae are visible macular dilated superficial blood vessels, which collapse upon pressure and fill slowly when pressure is released. Telangiectasiae in a scleroderma-like pattern are round and well demarcated and found on hands, lips, and inside of the mouth, and/or are large mat-like telangiectasiae. Distinguishable from rapidly filling spider angiomas with central arteriole and from dilated superficial vessels. Abnormal nailfold capillary pattern consistent with systemic sclerosis Enlarged capillaries and/or capillary loss with or without pericapillary hemorrhages at the nailfold. May also be seen on the cuticle. Pulmonary arterial hypertension Pulmonary arterial hypertension diagnosed by right-sided heart catheterization according to standard definitions. Interstitial lung disease Pulmonary fibrosis seen on high-resolution computed tomography or chest radiography, most pronounced in the basilar portions of the lungs, or occurrence of \"Velcro\" crackles on auscultation, not due to another cause such as congestive heart failure. Raynaud's phenomenon Self-reported or reported by a physician, with at least a two-phase color change in finger(s) and often toe(s) consisting of pallor, cyanosis, and/or reactive hyperemia in response to cold exposure or emotion; usually one phase is pallor. SSc-related autoantibodies Anticentromere antibody or centromere pattern seen on antinuclear antibody testing, anti-topoisomerase I antibody (also known as anti-Scl-70 antibody), or anti-RNA polymerase III antibody. Positive according to local laboratory standards. 1980 ACR Idiopathic Inflammatory Myositis Bohan and Peter (1975) Criteria Definition A Proximal and symmetrical muscle weakenss of the pelvic and scapular girdle, anterior flexors of the neck, progressing for weeks to months, with or without dysphagia or involvement of respiratory muscles B Elevation of the serum levels of skeletal muscle enzymes: creatine kinase, aspartate aminotrasnferase, lactate dehydrogenase and aldolase C Electromyography characteristic of myopathy (short and small motor units, fibrillation, positive pointy waves, insertional irritability and repetitive high-frequency firing) D Muscle biopsy showing necrosis, phagocytosis, regeneration, perifascicular atrophy, perivascular inflamnmatory exudate E Typical cutaneous changes: [1] Heliotrope rash with periorbital oedema and violaceous erythema [2] Gottron's sigh : vasculitis in the elbow, metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints Polymyositis [1] Definite - all of A-D [2] Probable - any three of A-D [3] Possible - any two of A-D Dermatomyositis [1] Definite - E plus three of A-D [2] Probable - E plus two of A-D [3] Possible - E plus one of A-D 2017 ACR When no better explanation for the symptoms and signs exists, these classification criteria can be used score points Variable without muscle biopsy with muscle biopsy Definition Age of onset Age of onset of first symptom assumed to be related to the disease \u226518 years and <40 years 1.3 1.5 18 \u2264 age (years) at onset of first symptom assumed to be related to the disease <40 Age of onset of first symptom assumed to be related to the disease \u226540 years 2.1 2.2 Age (years) at onset of first symptom assumed to be related to the disease \u226540 Muscle weakness Objective symmetric weakness, usually progressive, of the proximal upper extremities 0.7 0.7 Weakness of proximal upper extremities as defined by manual muscle testing or other objective strength testing, which is present on both sides and is usually progressive over time Objective symmetric weakness, usually progressive, of the proximal lower extremities 0.8 0.5 Weakness of proximal lower extremities as defined by manual muscle testing or other objective strength testing, which is present on both sides and is usually progressive over time Neck flexors are relatively weaker than neck extensors 1.9 1.6 Muscle grades for neck flexors are relatively lower than neck extensors as defined by manual muscle testing or other objective strength testing In the legs, proximal muscles are relatively weaker than distal muscles 0.9 1.2 Muscle grades for proximal muscles in the legs are relatively lower than distal muscles in the legs as defined by manual muscle testing or other objective strength testing Skin manifestations Heliotrope rash 3.1 3.2 Purple, lilac-colored, or erythematous patches over the eyelids or in a periorbital distribution, often associated with periorbital edema Gottron\u2019s papules 2.1 2.7 Erythematous to violaceous papules over the extensor surfaces of joints, which are sometimes scaly.

Thrombosis must be confirmed by objective validated criteria (ie, unequivocal findings of appropriate imaging studies or histopathology). For histopathologic confirmation, thrombosis should be present without significant evidence of inflammation in the vessel wall 2. Pregnancy morbidity a. One or more unexplained deaths of a morphologically normal fetus at or beyond the 10th week of gestation, with normal fetal morphology documented by ultrasound or by direct examination of the fetus; or b. One or more premature births of a morphologically normal neonate before the 34th week of gestation because of: (i) eclampsia or severe preeclampsia defined according to standard definitions, or (ii) recognized features of placental insufficiency\u00a7; or c. Three or more unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation, with maternal anatomic or hormonal abnormalities and paternal and maternal chromosomal causes excluded. In studies of populations of patients who have more than one type of pregnancy morbidity, investigators are strongly encouraged to stratify groups of subjects according to a, b, or c above. Laboratory criteria\u00a5 1. LA present in plasma, on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart, detected according to the guidelines of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (Scientific Subcommittee on LAs/phospholipid-dependent antibodies). 2. aCL of IgG and/or IgM isotype in serum or plasma, present in medium or high titer (ie, >40 GPL or MPL, or >the 99th percentile), on two or more occasions, at least 12 weeks apart, measured by a standardized ELISA. 3. Anti-beta-2 glycoprotein-I antibody of IgG and/or IgM isotype in serum or plasma (in titer >the 99th percentile), present on two or more occasions, at least 12 weeks apart, measured by a standardized ELISA, according to recommended procedures. * Classification of APS should be avoided if less than 12 weeks or more than five years separate the positive aPL test and the clinical manifestation. \u00b6 Coexisting inherited or acquired factors for thrombosis are not reasons for excluding patients from APS trials. However, two subgroups of APS patients should be recognized, according to: (a) the presence; and (b) the absence of additional risk factors for thrombosis. Indicative (but not exhaustive) cases include: age (>55 in men and >65 in women) and the presence of any of the established risk factors for cardiovascular disease (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, elevated LDL or low HDL cholesterol, cigarette smoking, family history of premature cardiovascular disease, body mass index \u226530 kg m\u20132, microalbuminuria, estimated GFR <60 mL minute\u20131), inherited thrombophilias, oral contraceptives, nephrotic syndrome, malignancy, immobilization, and surgery. Thus, patients who fulfill criteria should be stratified according to contributing causes of thrombosis. \u0394 A thrombotic episode in the past could be considered as a clinical criterion, provided that thrombosis is proved by appropriate diagnostic means and that no alternative diagnosis or cause of thrombosis is found. \u25ca Superficial venous thrombosis is not included in the clinical criteria. \u00a7 Generally accepted features of placental insufficiency include: (i) abnormal or non-reassuring fetal surveillance test(s), eg, a non-reactive non-stress test, suggestive of fetal hypoxemia; (ii) abnormal Doppler flow velocimetry waveform analysis suggestive of fetal hypoxemia, eg, absent end-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery; (iii) oligohydramnios, eg, an amniotic fluid index of 5 cm or less; or (iv) a postnatal birth weight less than the 10th percentile for the gestational age. \u00a5 Investigators are strongly advised to classify APS patients in studies into one of the following categories: I, more than one laboratory criteria present (any combination); IIa, LA present alone; IIb, aCL antibody present alone; IIc, anti-beta-2 glycoprotein-I antibody present alone.","title":"Revised Antiphospholipid Syndrome 5"},{"location":"intro/criteria/#rheumatoid-arthritis","text":"","title":"Rheumatoid arthritis"},{"location":"intro/criteria/#2010-acreular-classification-criteria","text":"Target population (Who should be tested?): Patients who 1.

In addition, patients with erosive disease typical of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with a history compatible with prior fulfillment of the 2010 criteria should be classified as having RA. Patients with longstanding disease, including those whose disease is inactive (with or without treatment) who, based on retrospectively available data, have previously fulfilled the 2010 criteria should be classified as having RA. \u2020Differential diagnoses vary among patients with different presentations but may include conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and gout. If it is unclear about the relevant differential diagnoses to consider, an expert rheumatologist should be consulted. \u2021Although patients with a score of 6 of 10 are not classifiable as having RA, their status can be reassessed, and the criteria might be fulfilled cumulatively over time. \u00a7Joint involvement refers to any swollen or tender joint on examination, which may be confirmed by imaging evidence of synovitis. Distal interphalangeal joints, first carpometacarpal joints, and first metatarsophalangeal joints are excluded from assessment. Categories of joint distribution are classified according to the location and number of involved joints, with placement into the highest category possible based on the pattern of joint involvement. \u2225\u201cLarge joints\u201d refers to shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles. \u00b6\u201cSmall joints\u201d refers to the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, second through fifth metatarsophalangeal joints, thumb interphalangeal joints, and wrists. **In this category, at least one of the involved joints must be a small joint; the other joints can include any combination of large and additional small joints, as well as other joints not specifically listed elsewhere (e.g., temporomandibular, acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular). \u2020\u2020Negative refers to IU values that are less than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory and assay; low-positive refers to IU values that are higher than the ULN but \u22643 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay; high-positive refers to IU values that are \u22653 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay.

A patient is classified as having SLE if he or she satisfies 4 of the clinical and immunologic criteria used in the SLICC classification criteria, including at least 1 clinical criterion and 1 immunologic criterion. \u0394 Alternatively, according to the SLICC criteria, a patient is classified as having SLE if he or she has biopsy-proven nephritis compatible with SLE in the presence of ANAs or anti-dsDNA antibodies.","title":"1997 ACR &amp; 2012 SLICC"},{"location":"intro/criteria/#sjogren-syndrome","text":"","title":"Sjogren syndrome"},{"location":"intro/criteria/#2016-acreular-classification-criteria-for-primary-sjogren-syndrome","text":"The classification of primary SS applies to any individual who meets the inclusion criteria\u00a7, does not have any of the conditions listed as exclusion criteria\u00a5, and has a score \u22654 when the weights from the five criteria items are summed.

Duration of symptoms\u00a7\u00a7 <6 weeks 0 \u22656 weeks 1 \u2021Although patients with a score of 6 of 10 are not classifiable as having RA, their status can be reassessed, and the criteria might be fulfilled cumulatively over time. \u00a7Joint involvement refers to any swollen or tender joint on examination, which may be confirmed by imaging evidence of synovitis. Distal interphalangeal joints, first carpometacarpal joints, and first metatarsophalangeal joints are excluded from assessment. Categories of joint distribution are classified according to the location and number of involved joints, with placement into the highest category possible based on the pattern of joint involvement. \u2225\u201cLarge joints\u201d refers to shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles. \u00b6\u201cSmall joints\u201d refers to the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, second through fifth metatarsophalangeal joints, thumb interphalangeal joints, and wrists. **In this category, at least one of the involved joints must be a small joint; the other joints can include any combination of large and additional small joints, as well as other joints not specifically listed elsewhere (e.g., temporomandibular, acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular). \u2020\u2020Negative refers to IU values that are less than or equal to the upper limit of normal (ULN) for the laboratory and assay; low-positive refers to IU values that are higher than the ULN but \u22643 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay; high-positive refers to IU values that are \u22653 times the ULN for the laboratory and assay. When rheumatoid factor (RF) information is only available as positive or negative, a positive result should be scored as low positive for RF. \u2021\u2021Normal and abnormal are determined by local laboratory standards. \u00a7\u00a7Duration of symptoms refers to patient self-report of the duration of signs or symptoms of synovitis (e.g., pain, swelling, tenderness) of joints that are clinically involved at the time of assessment regardless of treatment status.

Ann Rheum Dis. 2010;69(9):1580-1588. [20699241] For classification purposes, a patient has RA if at least four of these criteria are satisfied (the first four must have been present for at least six weeks). Criterion Description Morning stiffness Morning stiffness in and around the joints, lasting at least one hour before maximal improvement. Arthritis of three or more joint areas At least three joint areas (out of 14 possible areas; right or left PIP, MCP, wrist, elbow, knee, ankle, MTP joints) simultaneously have had soft tissue swelling or fluid (not bony overgrowth alone) as observed by a physician. Arthritis of hand joints At least one area swollen (as defined above) in a wrist, MCP, or PIP joint. Symmetric arthritis Simultaneous involvement of the same joint areas (as defined above) on both sides of the body (bilateral involvement of PIPs, MCPs, or MTPs, without absolute symmetry is acceptable). Rheumatoid nodules Subcutaneous nodules over bony prominences or extensor surfaces, or in juxta-articular regions as observed by a physician. Serum rheumatoid factor Demonstration of abnormal amounts of serum rheumatoid factor by any method for which the result has been positive in less than 5 percent of normal control subjects. Radiographic changes Radiographic changes typical of rheumatoid arthritis on posteroanterior hand or wrist radiographs, which must include erosions or unequivocal bony decalcification localised in, or most marked adjacent to, the involved joints (osteoarthritis changes alone do not qualify).

The classification is based upon 11 criteria. For the purpose of identifying patients in clinical studies, a person is said to have SLE if any 4 or more of the 11 criteria are present, serially or simultaneously, during any interval of observation. \u00b6 For the SLICC criteria, criteria are cumulative and need not be presently concurrently. A patient is classified as having SLE if he or she satisfies 4 of the clinical and immunologic criteria used in the SLICC classification criteria, including at least 1 clinical criterion and 1 immunologic criterion. \u0394 Alternatively, according to the SLICC criteria, a patient is classified as having SLE if he or she has biopsy-proven nephritis compatible with SLE in the presence of ANAs or anti-dsDNA antibodies.

Classification & Nomenclature 1. Definition of Vessel size Large vessel : aorta and its major branches. Any size artery may be affected. Medium-sized vessel : main visceral arteries and their branches. Inflammatory aneurysms are common. Small vessel : small intraparenchymal arteries, arterioles, capillaries and venules. Medium sized arteries and veins may be affected. 2. Vessel size and classification Large vessel : TA, GCA Medium vessel : PAN, Kawasaki disease Small vessel ANCA-Associated Vasculitis : MPA, GPA, EGPA Immune complex-mediated : Cryoblobulinemic vasculitis, IgA vasculitis, Anti-C1q vasculitis, Anti-GBM vasculitis 3. CHCC 2012 Nomenclature CHCC2012 Name CHCC2012 Definition Large vessel vasculitis (LVV) Vasculitis affecting large arteries more often than other vasculitides. Large arteries are the aorta and its major branches. Any size artery may be affected. Takayasu arteritis (TAK) Arteritis, often granulomatous, predominantly affecting the aorta and/or its major branches. Onset usually in patients younger than 50 years. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) Arteritis, often granulomatous, usually affecting the aorta and/or its major branches, with a predilection for the branches of the carotid and vertebral arteries. Often involves the temporal artery. Onset usually in patients older than 50 years and often associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. Medium vessel vasculitis (MVV) Vasculitis predominantly affecting medium arteries defined as the main visceral arteries and their branches. Any size artery may be affected. Inflammatory aneurysms and stenoses are common. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) Necrotizing arteritis of medium or small arteries without glomerulonephritis or vasculitis in arterioles, capillaries, or venules, and not associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs). Kawasaki disease (KD) Arteritis associated with the mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome and predominantly affecting medium and small arteries. Coronary arteries are often involved. Aorta and large arteries may be involved. Usually occurs in infants and young children. Small vessel vasculitis (SVV) Vasculitis predominantly affecting small vessels, defined as small intraparenchymal arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and venules. Medium arteries and veins may be affected. ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) Necrotizing vasculitis, with few or no immune deposits, predominantly affecting small vessels (i.e., capillaries, venules, arterioles, and small arteries), associated with myeloperoxidase (MPO) ANCA or proteinase 3 (PR3) ANCA. Not all patients have ANCA. Add a prefix indicating ANCA reactivity, e.g., MPO-ANCA, PR3-ANCA, ANCAnegative. Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) Necrotizing vasculitis, with few or no immune deposits, predominantly affecting small vessels (i.e., capillaries, venules, or arterioles). Necrotizing arteritis involving small and medium arteries may be present. Necrotizing glomerulonephritis is very common. Pulmonary capillaritis often occurs. Granulomatous inflammation is absent. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener\u2019s) (GPA) Necrotizing granulomatous inflammation usually involving the upper and lower respiratory tract, and necrotizing vasculitis affecting predominantly small to medium vessels (e.g., capillaries, venules, arterioles, arteries and veins). Necrotizing glomerulonephritis is common. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (ChurgStrauss) (EGPA) Eosinophil-rich and necrotizing granulomatous inflammation often involving the respiratory tract, and necrotizing vasculitis predominantly affecting small to medium vessels, and associated with asthma and eosinophilia. ANCA is more frequent when glomerulonephritis is present. Immune complex vasculitis Vasculitis with moderate to marked vessel wall deposits of immunoglobulin and/or complement components predominantly affecting small vessels (i.e., capillaries, venules, arterioles, and small arteries). Glomerulonephritis is frequent. Anti\u2013glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease Vasculitis affecting glomerular capillaries, pulmonary capillaries, or both, with GBM deposition of anti-GBM autoantibodies. Lung involvement causes pulmonary hemorrhage, and renal involvement causes glomerulonephritis with necrosis and crescents. Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (CV) Vasculitis with cryoglobulin immune deposits affecting small vessels (predominantly capillaries, venules, or arterioles) and associated with serum cryoglobulins. Skin, glomeruli, and peripheral nerves are often involved. IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Scho\u00a8nlein) (IgAV) Vasculitis, with IgA1-dominant immune deposits, affecting small vessels (predominantly capillaries, venules, or arterioles). Often involves skin and gastrointestinal tract, and frequently causes arthritis. Glomerulonephritis indistinguishable from IgA nephropathy may occur. Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUV) (anti-C1q vasculitis) Vasculitis accompanied by urticaria and hypocomplementemia affecting small vessels (i.e., capillaries, venules, or arterioles), and associated with anti-C1q antibodies. Glomerulonephritis, arthritis, obstructive pulmonary disease, and ocular inflammation are common. Variable vessel vasculitis (VVV) Vasculitis with no predominant type of vessel involved that can affect vessels of any size (small, medium, and large) and type (arteries, veins, and capillaries). Behcet\u2019s disease (BD) Vasculitis occurring in patients with Behc \u00b8et\u2019s disease that can affect arteries or veins. Behc \u00b8et\u2019s disease is characterized by recurrent oral and/or genital aphthous ulcers accompanied by cutaneous, ocular, articular, gastrointestinal, and/or central nervous system inflammatory lesions. Small vessel vasculitis, thromboangiitis, thrombosis, arteritis, and arterial aneurysms may occur. Cogan\u2019s syndrome (CS) Vasculitis occurring in patients with Cogan\u2019s syndrome. Cogan\u2019s syndrome characterized by ocular inflammatory lesions, including interstitial keratitis, uveitis, and episcleritis, and inner ear disease, including sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. Vasculitic manifestations may include arteritis (affecting small, medium, or large arteries), aortitis, aortic aneurysms, and aortic and mitral valvulitis. Single-organ vasculitis (SOV) Vasculitis in arteries or veins of any size in a single organ that has no features that indicate that it is a limited expression of a systemic vasculitis. The involved organ and vessel type should be included in the name (e.g., cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, testicular arteritis, central nervous system vasculitis). Vasculitis distribution may be unifocal or multifocal (diffuse) within an organ. Some patients originally diagnosed as having SOV will develop additional disease manifestations that warrant redefining the case as one of the systemic vasculitides (e.g., cutaneous arteritis later becoming systemic polyarteritis nodosa, etc.). Vasculitis associated with systemic disease Vasculitis that is associated with and may be secondary to (caused by) a systemic disease. The name (diagnosis) should have a prefix term specifying the systemic disease (e.g., rheumatoid vasculitis, lupus vasculitis, etc.). Vasculitis associated with probable etiology Vasculitis that is associated with a probable specific etiology. The name (diagnosis) should have a prefix term specifying the association (e.g., hydralazine-associated microscopic polyangiitis, hepatitis B virus\u2013associated vasculitis, hepatitis C virus\u2013associated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, etc.). 4.

Vessel size and classification"},{"location":"vasculitis/vasculitis/#3-chcc-2012-nomenclature","text":"CHCC2012 Name CHCC2012 Definition Large vessel vasculitis (LVV) Vasculitis affecting large arteries more often than other vasculitides. Large arteries are the aorta and its major branches. Any size artery may be affected. Takayasu arteritis (TAK) Arteritis, often granulomatous, predominantly affecting the aorta and/or its major branches. Onset usually in patients younger than 50 years. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) Arteritis, often granulomatous, usually affecting the aorta and/or its major branches, with a predilection for the branches of the carotid and vertebral arteries. Often involves the temporal artery. Onset usually in patients older than 50 years and often associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. Medium vessel vasculitis (MVV) Vasculitis predominantly affecting medium arteries defined as the main visceral arteries and their branches. Any size artery may be affected. Inflammatory aneurysms and stenoses are common. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) Necrotizing arteritis of medium or small arteries without glomerulonephritis or vasculitis in arterioles, capillaries, or venules, and not associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs). Kawasaki disease (KD) Arteritis associated with the mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome and predominantly affecting medium and small arteries. Coronary arteries are often involved. Aorta and large arteries may be involved. Usually occurs in infants and young children. Small vessel vasculitis (SVV) Vasculitis predominantly affecting small vessels, defined as small intraparenchymal arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and venules. Medium arteries and veins may be affected. ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) Necrotizing vasculitis, with few or no immune deposits, predominantly affecting small vessels (i.e., capillaries, venules, arterioles, and small arteries), associated with myeloperoxidase (MPO) ANCA or proteinase 3 (PR3) ANCA. Not all patients have ANCA. Add a prefix indicating ANCA reactivity, e.g., MPO-ANCA, PR3-ANCA, ANCAnegative. Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) Necrotizing vasculitis, with few or no immune deposits, predominantly affecting small vessels (i.e., capillaries, venules, or arterioles). Necrotizing arteritis involving small and medium arteries may be present. Necrotizing glomerulonephritis is very common. Pulmonary capillaritis often occurs. Granulomatous inflammation is absent. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener\u2019s) (GPA) Necrotizing granulomatous inflammation usually involving the upper and lower respiratory tract, and necrotizing vasculitis affecting predominantly small to medium vessels (e.g., capillaries, venules, arterioles, arteries and veins). Necrotizing glomerulonephritis is common. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (ChurgStrauss) (EGPA) Eosinophil-rich and necrotizing granulomatous inflammation often involving the respiratory tract, and necrotizing vasculitis predominantly affecting small to medium vessels, and associated with asthma and eosinophilia. ANCA is more frequent when glomerulonephritis is present. Immune complex vasculitis Vasculitis with moderate to marked vessel wall deposits of immunoglobulin and/or complement components predominantly affecting small vessels (i.e., capillaries, venules, arterioles, and small arteries). Glomerulonephritis is frequent. Anti\u2013glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) disease Vasculitis affecting glomerular capillaries, pulmonary capillaries, or both, with GBM deposition of anti-GBM autoantibodies. Lung involvement causes pulmonary hemorrhage, and renal involvement causes glomerulonephritis with necrosis and crescents. Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (CV) Vasculitis with cryoglobulin immune deposits affecting small vessels (predominantly capillaries, venules, or arterioles) and associated with serum cryoglobulins. Skin, glomeruli, and peripheral nerves are often involved. IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Scho\u00a8nlein) (IgAV) Vasculitis, with IgA1-dominant immune deposits, affecting small vessels (predominantly capillaries, venules, or arterioles). Often involves skin and gastrointestinal tract, and frequently causes arthritis. Glomerulonephritis indistinguishable from IgA nephropathy may occur. Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis (HUV) (anti-C1q vasculitis) Vasculitis accompanied by urticaria and hypocomplementemia affecting small vessels (i.e., capillaries, venules, or arterioles), and associated with anti-C1q antibodies. Glomerulonephritis, arthritis, obstructive pulmonary disease, and ocular inflammation are common. Variable vessel vasculitis (VVV) Vasculitis with no predominant type of vessel involved that can affect vessels of any size (small, medium, and large) and type (arteries, veins, and capillaries). Behcet\u2019s disease (BD) Vasculitis occurring in patients with Behc \u00b8et\u2019s disease that can affect arteries or veins. Behc \u00b8et\u2019s disease is characterized by recurrent oral and/or genital aphthous ulcers accompanied by cutaneous, ocular, articular, gastrointestinal, and/or central nervous system inflammatory lesions. Small vessel vasculitis, thromboangiitis, thrombosis, arteritis, and arterial aneurysms may occur. Cogan\u2019s syndrome (CS) Vasculitis occurring in patients with Cogan\u2019s syndrome. Cogan\u2019s syndrome characterized by ocular inflammatory lesions, including interstitial keratitis, uveitis, and episcleritis, and inner ear disease, including sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. Vasculitic manifestations may include arteritis (affecting small, medium, or large arteries), aortitis, aortic aneurysms, and aortic and mitral valvulitis. Single-organ vasculitis (SOV) Vasculitis in arteries or veins of any size in a single organ that has no features that indicate that it is a limited expression of a systemic vasculitis. The involved organ and vessel type should be included in the name (e.g., cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, testicular arteritis, central nervous system vasculitis). Vasculitis distribution may be unifocal or multifocal (diffuse) within an organ. Some patients originally diagnosed as having SOV will develop additional disease manifestations that warrant redefining the case as one of the systemic vasculitides (e.g., cutaneous arteritis later becoming systemic polyarteritis nodosa, etc.). Vasculitis associated with systemic disease Vasculitis that is associated with and may be secondary to (caused by) a systemic disease. The name (diagnosis) should have a prefix term specifying the systemic disease (e.g., rheumatoid vasculitis, lupus vasculitis, etc.). Vasculitis associated with probable etiology Vasculitis that is associated with a probable specific etiology. The name (diagnosis) should have a prefix term specifying the association (e.g., hydralazine-associated microscopic polyangiitis, hepatitis B virus\u2013associated vasculitis, hepatitis C virus\u2013associated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, etc.).","title":"3.
