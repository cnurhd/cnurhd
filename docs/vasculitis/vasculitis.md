| CHCC2012 Name                                                | CHCC2012 Definition                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Large vessel vasculitis (LVV)**                            | Vasculitis affecting large arteries more often than other vasculitides.  Large arteries are the aorta and its major branches. Any size artery may be  affected. |
| Takayasu arteritis (TAK)                                     | Arteritis, often granulomatous, predominantly affecting the aorta and/or  its major branches. Onset usually in patients younger than 50 years. |
| Giant cell arteritis (GCA)                                   | Arteritis, often granulomatous, usually affecting the aorta and/or its  major branches, with a predilection for the branches of the carotid and  vertebral arteries. Often involves the temporal artery. Onset usually in  patients older than 50 years and often associated with polymyalgia  rheumatica. |
| **Medium vessel vasculitis (MVV)**                           | Vasculitis predominantly affecting medium arteries defined as the main  visceral arteries and their branches. Any size artery may be affected.  Inflammatory aneurysms and stenoses are common. |
| Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN)                                   | Necrotizing arteritis of medium or small arteries without  glomerulonephritis or vasculitis in arterioles, capillaries, or venules, and  not associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs). |
| Kawasaki disease (KD)                                        | Arteritis associated with the mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome and  predominantly affecting medium and small arteries. Coronary arteries are  often involved. Aorta and large arteries may be involved. Usually occurs in  infants and young children. |
| **Small vessel vasculitis (SVV)**                            | Vasculitis predominantly affecting small vessels, defined as small  intraparenchymal arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and venules. Medium  arteries and veins may be affected. |
| **ANCA-associated vasculitis  (AAV)**                        | Necrotizing vasculitis, with few or no immune deposits, predominantly  affecting small vessels (i.e., capillaries, venules, arterioles, and small  arteries), associated with myeloperoxidase (MPO) ANCA or proteinase 3 (PR3)  ANCA. Not all patients have ANCA. Add a prefix indicating ANCA reactivity,  e.g., MPO-ANCA, PR3-ANCA, ANCAnegative. |
| Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA)                               | Necrotizing vasculitis, with few or no immune deposits, predominantly  affecting small vessels (i.e., capillaries, venules, or arterioles).  Necrotizing arteritis involving small and medium arteries may be present.  Necrotizing glomerulonephritis is very common. Pulmonary capillaritis often  occurs. Granulomatous inflammation is absent. |
| Granulomatosis with polyangiitis  (Wegener’s) (GPA)          | Necrotizing granulomatous inflammation usually involving the upper and  lower respiratory tract, and necrotizing vasculitis affecting predominantly  small to medium vessels (e.g., capillaries, venules, arterioles, arteries and  veins). Necrotizing glomerulonephritis is common. |
| Eosinophilic granulomatosis with  polyangiitis (ChurgStrauss) (EGPA) | Eosinophil-rich and necrotizing granulomatous inflammation often  involving the respiratory tract, and necrotizing vasculitis predominantly  affecting small to medium vessels, and associated with asthma and  eosinophilia. ANCA is more frequent when glomerulonephritis is present. |
| **Immune complex vasculitis**                                | Vasculitis with moderate to marked vessel wall deposits of immunoglobulin  and/or complement components predominantly affecting small vessels (i.e.,  capillaries, venules, arterioles, and small arteries). Glomerulonephritis is  frequent. |
| Anti–glomerular basement membrane  (anti-GBM) disease        | Vasculitis affecting glomerular capillaries, pulmonary capillaries, or  both, with GBM deposition of anti-GBM autoantibodies. Lung involvement causes  pulmonary hemorrhage, and renal involvement causes glomerulonephritis with  necrosis and crescents. |
| Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (CV)                             | Vasculitis with cryoglobulin immune deposits affecting small vessels  (predominantly capillaries, venules, or arterioles) and associated with serum  cryoglobulins. Skin, glomeruli, and peripheral nerves are often involved. |
| IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Scho¨nlein) (IgAV)                    | Vasculitis, with IgA1-dominant immune deposits, affecting small vessels  (predominantly capillaries, venules, or arterioles). Often involves skin and  gastrointestinal tract, and frequently causes arthritis. Glomerulonephritis  indistinguishable from IgA nephropathy may occur. |
| Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis  (HUV) (anti-C1q vasculitis) | Vasculitis accompanied by urticaria and hypocomplementemia affecting  small vessels (i.e., capillaries, venules, or arterioles), and associated  with anti-C1q antibodies. Glomerulonephritis, arthritis, obstructive  pulmonary disease, and ocular inflammation are common. |
| **Variable vessel vasculitis  (VVV)**                        | Vasculitis with no predominant type of vessel involved that can affect  vessels of any size (small, medium, and large) and type (arteries, veins, and  capillaries). |
| Behcet’s disease (BD)                                        | Vasculitis occurring in patients with Behc ¸et’s disease that can affect  arteries or veins. Behc ¸et’s disease is characterized by recurrent oral  and/or genital aphthous ulcers accompanied by cutaneous, ocular, articular,  gastrointestinal, and/or central nervous system inflammatory lesions. Small  vessel vasculitis, thromboangiitis, thrombosis, arteritis, and arterial  aneurysms may occur. |
| Cogan’s syndrome (CS)                                        | Vasculitis occurring in patients with Cogan’s syndrome. Cogan’s syndrome  characterized by ocular inflammatory lesions, including interstitial  keratitis, uveitis, and episcleritis, and inner ear disease, including  sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular dysfunction. Vasculitic  manifestations may include arteritis (affecting small, medium, or large  arteries), aortitis, aortic aneurysms, and aortic and mitral valvulitis. |
| **Single-organ vasculitis  (SOV)**                           | Vasculitis in arteries or veins of any size in a single organ that has no  features that indicate that it is a limited expression of a systemic  vasculitis. The involved organ and vessel type should be included in the name  (e.g., cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, testicular arteritis, central  nervous system vasculitis). Vasculitis distribution may be unifocal or  multifocal (diffuse) within an organ. Some patients originally diagnosed as  having SOV will develop additional disease manifestations that warrant  redefining the case as one of the systemic vasculitides (e.g., cutaneous  arteritis later becoming systemic polyarteritis nodosa, etc.). |
| **Vasculitis associated with  systemic disease**             | Vasculitis that is associated with and may be secondary to (caused by) a  systemic disease. The name (diagnosis) should have a prefix term specifying  the systemic disease (e.g., rheumatoid vasculitis, lupus vasculitis, etc.). |
| **Vasculitis associated with  probable etiology**            | Vasculitis that is associated with a probable specific etiology. The name  (diagnosis) should have a prefix term specifying the association (e.g.,  hydralazine-associated microscopic polyangiitis, hepatitis B virus–associated  vasculitis, hepatitis C virus–associated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis,  etc.). |

## 4. Diagnosis

*** There are no current diagnostic (as opposed to classification) criteria **

- Behcet's ds.도 이름은 diagnostic criteria 이지만 실상은 classification criteria이다.



### 1. 1990 ACR classification criteria

-> ACR 기준으로 분류하면 오류가 많다. (Rheumatology, 2017;56:1154)



## 5. Essential steps for diagnosis of vasculitis

1. Recognition that the patient might have vasculitis : 의심!
2. Exclusion of mimics and secondary causes of vasculitis including drugs
3. A compatible phenotype and  serology (e.g. ANCA)
4. Confirmation by radiology (e.g. angiography) or histology
5. The increased certainty of diagnosis with time : 진단이 시간이 지나면서 바뀔 수도 있다.



### 1. Clinical features suggestive of vasculitis

**일단 의심해야 한다**

1. Mononeuritis multiplex
2. Palpable purpura
3. Pulmonary renal involvement
4. Unexplained ischemic events
5. Absent pulse, bruit
6. Fever of Unknown Origin*
7. Etc.



### 2. Investigations of suspected vasculitis

**Systemic + Localized Sx. 확인**

1. Detailed history taking and physical examination are essential
2. General (Inflammation)
   - CBC, eosinophil, ESR/CRP, LFT, ANCA (Elisa/IIF)
3. Organ involvement
   - U/A, RFT, LFT, CXR
   - Where appropriate : NCV, MRI, CSF exam, EKG, 2DE, PET-CT
4. Differential diagnosis
   - Blood cultures, viral serology (HBV, HCV, HIV, CMV), Anti-cardiolipin antibody, cryoglobulin, complement, ANA, RF, echocardiography



### 3. Exclusion of vasculitis mimics

### 5. Confirmation by histology (or angiography)

1. When to biopsy?
   - Acute active stage
   - Within 2 weeks after starting treatment
2. Where to biopsy?
   - Active sites : nasal cavity는 bx.를 했을 때 vessel에 infiltration이 안 될 수도 있다. (=yield가 낮은 편이다)
3. Findings
   - Necrotizing vasculitis
   - Leukocytoclasis (IgA vasculitis, Hypersensitivity vasculitis)
   - Granulomatous inflammation (GPA, EGPA, MPA, TA, GCA)



### 6. Monitoring
1. Vasculitis can relapse with different features from previous presentation
2. Vasculitis can relapse long after remission
3. Fibrotic sequelae of acute injury
