Perioperative management of Patients with Rheumatic Disease

## * General Principles

| Problem                                                      | Work-up                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Intubation Approach                                          | C-spine dynamogram, open mouth |
| Medication                                                   | Prescription                   |
| Disease specific issue<br />- Disease activity / Cardiac risk | Physical examination           |

** Appropriate management of anti-rheumatic medication and underlying disease in the perioperative period may provide an important opportunity to mitigate risk.



## 1. Intubation approach

### 1. Atlantoaxial Subluxation

#### 1. Definition and major symptoms
- Erosion of the odontoid process or the transverse ligament of C2
- The odontoid process to slip posteriorly & cause myelopathy/cord compression
- Neck pain: 40~88% in RA
- Sx: Posterior neck pain, headache, dizziness, tinnitus
-  Neuropathy Sx: weakness, clumsiness, coordination disturbances 



#### 2. Measurement
- Atlantodental distance
  - Anterior
    - 2~4mm: suggest
    - 7mm: instability
    - 2~9mm: risk for cord compression
  - Posterior
    - < 14 mm: Indication of surgery (ﬁxation)
- Image
  - Flexion-extension을 찍는다.
  - Open mouth view : loosening이 발생하면 양쪽 side 간격이 asymmetric하게 된다.



#### 3. Intubation technique
- Flexible fiberoptic inbutation





## 2. Medication

### 1. Glucocorticoid

#### 1. Cortisol secretion in Stress condition

- Normal basal secretion: 8-10mg/d
- Minor surgery or illness: 25-50mg/d
- Surgical stress: 75-150mg/d
- Severe stress (major trauma): 200-500mg/d



#### 2. HPA axis

- Normal HPA axis
  - Any dose of glucocorticoid for < 3 weeks
  - <= 5mg/d prednisolone daily
  - <=10mg/d prednisolone every other day
- HPA axis suppression
  - => 20mg/d prednisolone (=>3 weeks)
  - Clnical Cushing's syndrome



#### 3. Glucocorticoid replacement

| Risk                     | Example | Replacement |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ----------- |
| Minor surgery            |         |             |
| Moderate surgical stress |         |             |
| Major surgical stress    |         |             |



** Continue the current daily dose in patients with RA, SpA, or SLE who are receiving prednisolone <=15 mg/day undergoing THA or TKA, rather than administering perioperative "stress dosing”



### 2. NSAIDs

- 3~5 times the half life
- celecoxib는 bleeding 측면에서는 크게 걱정하지 않아도 된다.


### 3. DMARD & Immunosuppressant
- Medication of patients with TKA & THA
  - Biologics- 46% of RA
  - DMARDs - 67% of RA
  - lmmunosuppressants - 75% of SLE
#### 1. DMARDs
- Conventional DMARDs : Continue the current dose of MTX, LFN, HCQ, and/or SSZ
- Biologic DMARDs : Withhold all current biologic agents prior to surgery, plan the surgery at the end of the dosing cycle
- Tofacitinib : Withhold tofacitinib for at least 7 days prior to surgery
- Tocilizumab : suppress fever and increase of CRP after surgery
- Restart Biologics : The wound shows evidence of healing (~14 days), all sutures/staples are out, there is no significant swelling, erythema, or drainage, and there is no clinical evidence of non-surgical site infections

#### 2. Immunosuppressant
  - Severe SLE : continue the current dose of MTX, MMF, AZA, CsA or TAC
  - Severe SLE - severe organ manifestations : nephritis, CNS lupus, hemolytic anemia (Hb s 9.9), Pit 5 50k, vasculitis
    including pulmonary hemorrhage, myocarditis, pneumonitis, myoenteritis, hepatitis, severe keratitis/uveitis/scleritis, optic neuritis : SLEDAI를 활용한다.
  - Not severe SLE : Withhold the current dose of MTX, MMF, AZA, CsA or TAC 1 week prior



## 3. Disease-specific Issue

### 1. Sjogren syndrome

- Pilocarpine : hold d/t muscarinic effect
  - bronchospasm, bradycardia, involuntary urination, vomiting, hypotension, tremor
- Lubricating gel & artiﬁcial tears
- The use of anticholinergic medications should be minimized



### 2. Ankylosing spondylitis

- Regional anesthesia : ligament calcification & ossification



### 3. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome

- Aspirin (1 week), NOAC (약제에 따라)



### 4. Cardiac risk assessment

- Coronary disease
- Pulmonary artery hypertension

** Emergency가 아니라면 CV risk를 꼭 check한다.
